Hey, all. So I'm very passionate in general about CS, theory, applications, and problem-solving as the technologies around us grow at a rapid pace.

Check the "About Me" for a more detailed intro on me.

I also plan to capture the notes on many things that I've learned and stuff I'm interested in. Please follow the blog for more details.
